## MATCHUP REASONING

### High-Value Matchups (+8/0 or +6/+2)

#### 4-3-3 Press vs 3-5-2 Wide (+8/0)
**Why**:
- High press disrupts 3-5-2 build-up from back
- Wing-backs caught high when press wins ball
- Vertical passing exploits space behind
- 3-5-2 struggles to cope with intensity

**Example**: Liverpool 4-0 Barcelona (2019 UCL) - high press destroyed 3ATB build-up

---

#### 4-4-2 Compact vs 4-3-3 Posse (+6/+2)
**Why**:
- Compact block frustrates possession teams
- Two banks deny space
- Possession team forced wide
- Counter-attacks exploit slow transitions

**Example**: Burnley vs Manchester City - compact 4-4-2 can frustrate possession

---

#### 5-3-2 Def vs 4-3-3 Posse (+6/+2)
**Why**:
- Deep block denies space in behind
- 5 defenders vs 3 attackers = numerical advantage
- Possession team forced to cross
- Very difficult to break down

---

### Balanced Matchups (+4/+4 or +2/+2)

#### 4-3-3 Press vs 4-3-3 Press (0/0)
**Why**:
- Mirror matchup
- Both try to press high
- Tactical chess match
- Individual quality decides

---

#### 4-2-3-1 vs 4-2-3-1 (0/0)
**Why**:
- Same structure
- Balanced midfield
- No inherent advantage
- Execution matters most

---

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Inter (3-5-2) vs Lazio (4-3-3 Press)

**Looking at matrix**: 3-5-2 Wide (home) vs 4-3-3 Press (away) = 0/+8

**Interpretation**:
- Inter: 0 (no tactical advantage)
- Lazio: +8 (strong tactical advantage)

**Reasoning**:
- Lazio's high press will disrupt Inter's build-up
- Inter's wing-backs vulnerable when caught high
- Lazio can exploit spaces behind Inter's wing-backs
- Inter's 3ATB struggles vs intense pressing

**Q6 Scores**: Home: 0, Away: +8

---

### Example 2: Real Madrid (4-2-3-1) vs Atletico (4-4-2 Compact)

**Looking at matrix**: 4-2-3-1 (home) vs 4-4-2 Compact (away) = +4/+4

**Interpretation**:
- Both teams have moderate tactical advantage
- Real Madrid can control possession
- Atletico's block is solid

**Reasoning**:
- Real's 4-2-3-1 provides balanced structure
- Atletico's compact shape frustrates but can be broken
- Neither formation dominates
- Individual quality and execution critical

**Q6 Scores**: Home: +4, Away: +4

---

### Example 3: Manchester City (4-3-3 Posse) vs Burnley (5-3-2 Def)

**Looking at matrix**: 4-3-3 Posse (home) vs 5-3-2 Def (away) = +2/+6

**Interpretation**:
- Burnley: +6 (strong tactical advantage)
- City: +2 (slight advantage)

**Reasoning**:
- Burnley's deep 5-3-2 makes it very hard for City to penetrate
- City's possession doesn't guarantee goals vs low block
- Burnley needs patience and discipline
- City needs individual brilliance to break down

**Q6 Scores**: Home: +2, Away: +6

## FORMATION IDENTIFICATION GUIDE

### How to Identify Formations

**Sources**:
1. **Sports Mole** - tactical preview (most reliable)
2. **FotMob** - formation stats (recent games)
3. **SofaScore** - average formation
4. **Local media** - tactical articles

**Keywords to search**:
- "formation", "lineup", "táctica", "formação"
- "4-3-3", "3-5-2", etc.
- "three at the back", "wing-backs"
- "high press", "low block"

---

### Distinguishing Similar Formations

#### 4-3-3 Possession vs 4-3-3 Press
**Key difference**: Pressing intensity

**Check**:
- PPDA stat (Press <10, Posse >12)
- Match reports mentioning "high press" vs "control"
- Manager style (Klopp = Press, Guardiola = Posse)

**Default if unclear**: Use 4-3-3 Press (more common)

---

#### 4-4-2 Compact vs 4-2-3-1
**Key difference**: CAM vs flat midfield

**Check**:
- Does team have a dedicated #10?
- Tactical preview mentions "diamond" or "CAM"?
- Formation graphics

**Default if unclear**: Use 4-2-3-1 (more modern)

---

#### 3-5-2 vs 5-3-2
**Key difference**: Wing-backs vs full-backs

**Check**:
- Are wide players attacking (3-5-2) or defensive (5-3-2)?
- Team mentality (attacking = 3-5-2, defensive = 5-3-2)
- Home/Away context

**Default if unclear**: Use 3-5-2 at home, 5-3-2 away

---

## MISSING FORMATION DATA PROTOCOL

**If formation data unavailable**:

1. **Check manager's preferred system** (Transfermarkt coach page)
2. **Look at last 5 formations** (FotMob average)
3. **Use league defaults**:
   - **Premier League**: 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1
   - **Serie A**: 3-5-2 or 4-3-3
   - **La Liga**: 4-3-3 or 4-4-2
   - **Bundesliga**: 4-2-3-1 or 3-4-3
   - **Ligue 1**: 4-3-3 or 4-4-2
4. **Use 0/0 (symmetry) as last resort**

**Document**: "Q6: Formations not confirmed, used manager default 4-3-3 for both → 0/0"

## ADVANCED CONSIDERATIONS

### In-Game Tactical Changes

**Note**: This matrix applies to **starting formations only**

Managers may adapt during match:
- Trailing team may become more aggressive
- Leading team may become more defensive
- Red card forces formation change

**System limitation**: Cannot predict in-game changes
**Mitigation**: RG Guard picks up manager flexibility in TCG and KIP signals

---

### Manager Tactical Flexibility

Some managers are known to adapt formations mid-game:
- **High flexibility**: Ancelotti, Conte, Tuchel
- **Medium flexibility**: Guardiola, Klopp
- **Low flexibility**: Simeone, Allegri (stick to system)

**Future enhancement**: Add "Manager Adaptability" sub-factor to Q6

---

## SUMMARY

**Q6 Scoring Process**:
1. Identify home formation (Sports Mole, FotMob, SofaScore)
2. Identify away formation
3. Look up intersection in 7x7 matrix
4. Assign Home/Away scores
5. Document source and reasoning
6. If formations unclear, use defaults and note it

**Example documentation**:
```
Q6: Estrutura vs. Estrutura
- Home: Inter (3-5-2 Wide) - confirmed Sports Mole
- Away: Lazio (4-3-3 Press) - confirmed FotMob last 3 games
- Matrix lookup: 3-5-2 vs 4-3-3 Press = 0/+8
- Home Score: 0
- Away Score: +8
- Source: Sports Mole tactical preview + FotMob formation stats
